# Aurer
> A simple, KISS AUR helper

Aurer (AUR helpER) is mainly intended to help the user to learn and understand how an AUR package is installed, showing all the 4 basic steps involved in this process: 
1) Tarball download
2) Tarball decompression
3) Dependencies handling
4) Package build and installation

With less than 200 lines of code, and being only one source file, it may be easily modified and customized by the user. "I give you only a minimal program. Learn about it and make it your own"; this is the motto of the KISS principle, and this is what this script
is aimed to do.

## Installing Aurer:

1. Clone or download the project files (**no compilation nor installation** is required)

    $ git clone https://github.com/leo-arch/aurer/new/master

2. Excecute the script:
    
    $ cd aurer
    $ ./aurer.sh
